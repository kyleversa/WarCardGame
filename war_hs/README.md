# War Card Game - Haskell Implementation

## Overview
This is the Haskell implementation of the War card game. The game logic is implemented in the `War` module, and the game is run through the `Main.hs` file. This version uses **Cabal** as the build tool and package manager for Haskell.

## Requirements
- **Haskell**: You need to have the Haskell Platform installed, which includes **GHC** (the Haskell compiler) and **Cabal** (the build tool).
- You can download the Haskell Platform from [https://www.haskell.org/platform/](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Install Haskell
If you donâ€™t already have Haskell installed, follow the installation instructions at [https://www.haskell.org/platform/](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) to install both GHC and Cabal.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository or download the `war_hs` folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyleversa/WarCardGame.git
cd war_hs
